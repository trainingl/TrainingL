- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Xunlian Luo, a graduate student at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Spatial-Temporal Data Mining (especially traffic directions) and Graph Representation Learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Deep Learning Algorithms, JavaWeb Enterprise Project Development, and some fragmented Computer Technologies.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? You can communicate and cooperate with me via email xlluo@stu.suda.edu.cn.

*I am keen on blogging and technology sharing in my spare time.*
